# Fixing Web Deployment Issues for Donation App

This guide addresses specific errors encountered when deploying the Donation app to Vercel.

## Issues Fixed

1. **ServiceWorker MIME type error**:
   ```
   SecurityError: Failed to register a ServiceWorker: The script has an unsupported MIME type ('text/html')
   ```

2. **manifest.json syntax error**:
   ```
   Manifest: Line: 1, column: 1, Syntax error
   ```

3. **main.dart.js loading error**:
   ```
   Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<' (at main.dart.js:1:1)
   ```

## How We Fixed These Issues

The following changes were made to address these issues:

1. **Added proper MIME type configurations in vercel.json**:
   ```json
   {
     "routes": [
       { "src": "/flutter_service_worker.js", "headers": { "Content-Type": "application/javascript" } },
       { "src": "/(.*\\.js)$", "headers": { "Content-Type": "application/javascript" } },
       { "src": "/manifest.json", "headers": { "Content-Type": "application/manifest+json" } }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Updated index.html to use the latest Flutter web loader approach**:
   - Replaced the older service worker initialization with the newer pattern
   - Added proper handling for script loading errors
   - Added the missing mobile-web-app-capable meta tag

3. **Set appropriate build configuration**:
   - Used the correct build command in vercel.json
   - Created a build script with proper error handling

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push these changes to your repository**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix web deployment issues"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Import your project on Vercel
   - Use these settings:
     - Build Command: `flutter build web --release`
     - Output Directory: `build/web`
     - Install Command: Leave empty (handled by vercel.json)

3. **After deployment, verify**:
   - Open the browser console to check for errors
   - Ensure the service worker loads correctly
   - Verify the app initializes properly

## Local Testing

Test your web build locally before deploying:

```bash
flutter build web --release
cd build/web
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
